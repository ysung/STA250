DESCRIPTION:

We used the shell to computate the entire frequency table of counts of unique delay values. With the command "gunzip -c Delays1987_2013.tar.bz2 | cut -f 15 -d, | sort | uniq -c > FreqTable.txt
", we can generate a frequency table which extremely decreases the size of data. Then we import the data into R with the read.table command and then delete the NA rows. In the Delay function, the median, SD and mean can be generated by the easy formulas and we can get the result.
